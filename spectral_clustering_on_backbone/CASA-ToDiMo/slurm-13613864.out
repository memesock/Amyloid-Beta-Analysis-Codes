CASA-ToDiMo: Class Averaging via Spectral Analysis of Totally Disordered Macromolecules
Cornell University

Loading previously computed pairwise RMSDs...
Done.

Spectral clustering results vary depending on the RMSD threshold and # of K-means clusters declared.
Are you satisfied with the results? Enter 1 for yes, 0 for no (redo spectral clustering).
You do not need to recompute the pairwise RMSD matrix, so subsequent runs will take much less computing time.
Note that if many stray points are present in the graph that are completely disconnected from other points, the next step might not work.
