THIS CODE IS THE BETTER IMPLEMENTATION OF https://github.com/TongGeorgeWang/CASA-ToDiMo WHERE CODE IS ADJUSTED FOR MARTINI 3 SIMULATION RESULTS.


1. FIRST RUN THE PYTHON FILE TO GENERATE THE PDB FILES LESSER THAN THE CENTRE OF MASS BETWEEN TWO CHAINS AS SOME THRESHOLD OR MASKING. NEED NOT APPLY ALSO. I HAVE ALSO APPLIED A STRIDE OF 5 TO FINALLY HAVE 5,800 PDB STRUCTURES. THIS SEEMS OPTIMAL NUMBER OF PDB FILES, AS THE CODE ORIGINALLY IS ONLY MADE FOR THE HUNDEREDS OF PBDS ONLY. ONLY THE BACKBONE IS BEING SAVED IN THE PYTHON FILE FOR OPTIMAL SPACE AND REOSURCE USE.

2. FIRST CHANGE IN CODE FOR MARTINI STRUCTURES IS CHANGING CA TO BB AS THE PROTEIN BACKBONE IN MARTINI STRUCTURES ARE DENOTED BY BB

3. SECOND CHANGE IS THE REMOVING OF CONNECTIVITY SCORE  (EXPLAIN REASON) IN THE CALCULATION OF OKAYNESS SCORE
